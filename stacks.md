Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide and study material to help you understand stacks and solve stack-related problems effectively.

### 1. Understanding Stacks

**Stack Basics:**
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- Main operations:
  - `push()`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - `pop()`: Removes the top element from the stack.
  - `peek()` or `top()`: Returns the top element without removing it.
  - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.

- [GeeksforGeeks - Stack Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/)

### 2. Implementing a Stack in JavaScript

**Simple Stack Implementation:**
```javascript
class Stack {
    constructor() {
        this.items = [];
    }

    push(element) {
        this.items.push(element);
    }

    pop() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return "Stack is empty";
        }
        return this.items.pop();
    }

    peek() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return "Stack is empty";
        }
        return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.items.length === 0;
    }

    size() {
        return this.items.length;
    }

    printStack() {
        console.log(this.items.join(" "));
    }
}
```

- Calculate the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature.

## Monotonic Stack
A monotonic stack is a data structure used to maintain elements in a specific order, either increasing (monotonically increasing) or decreasing (monotonically decreasing). This property makes it particularly useful for solving problems where you need to find the next greater or smaller element in a sequence, among other things.

### Characteristics of a Monotonic Stack

1. **Monotonically Increasing Stack:**
   - Elements are stored in an increasing order.
   - The top of the stack has the largest element.
   - When a new element is added, elements are popped from the stack until the stack's order is maintained.

2. **Monotonically Decreasing Stack:**
   - Elements are stored in a decreasing order.
   - The top of the stack has the smallest element.
   - When a new element is added, elements are popped from the stack until the stack's order is maintained.

### Applications

Monotonic stacks are commonly used in algorithms to solve problems such as:

1. **Next Greater Element:**
   - Finding the next greater element for each element in an array.
2. **Next Smaller Element:**
   - Finding the next smaller element for each element in an array.
3. **Stock Span Problem:**
   - Finding the number of consecutive days the price of a stock has been less than or equal to today's price.
4. **Trapping Rain Water:**
   - Calculating how much water can be trapped between the bars after raining.

### Example of Monotonically Increasing Stack

Let's illustrate a monotonically increasing stack with an example:

Given an array: `[4, 5, 2, 10, 8]`, let's find the next greater element for each element using a monotonically increasing stack.

1. Start with an empty stack.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right:
   - For element `4`, the stack is empty, so push `4`.
   - For element `5`, `5` is greater than `4`, so pop `4` and push `5`.
   - For element `2`, `2` is not greater than `5`, so push `2`.
   - For element `10`, `10` is greater than `2` and `5`, so pop `2` and `5` and push `10`.
   - For element `8`, `8` is not greater than `10`, so push `8`.

At the end, the stack helps us find the next greater element for each position efficiently.

### Example Code in JavaScript

Here's an example of finding the next greater element using a monotonically increasing stack in JavaScript:

```javascript
function nextGreaterElement(arr) {
    let stack = [];
    let result = new Array(arr.length).fill(-1);

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        while (stack.length && arr[stack[stack.length - 1]] < arr[i]) {
            result[stack.pop()] = arr[i];
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
let arr = [4, 5, 2, 10, 8];
console.log(nextGreaterElement(arr));  // Output: [5, 10, 10, -1, -1]
```

In this code, we maintain a stack of indices. For each element in the array, we compare it with the elements at the indices stored in the stack. If the current element is greater, we pop the stack and update the result array with the current element. If not, we push the current index onto the stack. This ensures the stack maintains the necessary order for our computation.

- Using stacks to handle problems involving sequences or intervals.
- [LeetCode - Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/)

**Key Concepts:**
- Use a stack to keep track of car fleets based on their positions and speeds.

#### Problem 7: Largest Rectangle in Histogram

**Study Material:**
- Using a stack to find the largest rectangle in a histogram.
- [GeeksforGeeks - Largest Rectangular Area in a Histogram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-rectangle-under-histogram/)

**Key Concepts:**
- Use a stack to store the indices of the histogram bars.
- Calculate the area by considering each bar as the smallest (or limiting) bar in the rectangle.
