To solve these binary search questions, you need a good understanding of the binary search algorithm and its variations. Below are the key concepts and strategies for each type of problem, along with some notes and tips to help you master them.

### 1. Basic Binary Search
**Problem**: Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index of the target or -1 if it does not exist.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Search Algorithm**: This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **O(log n) Time Complexity**: Achieved by halving the search space in each iteration.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array.
2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
   - Calculate the middle index: `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is equal to the target, return `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is less than the target, update `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is greater than the target, update `right` to `mid - 1`.
3. If the target is not found, return -1.

### 2. Search in a 2D Matrix
**Problem**: Given a matrix where each row is sorted and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row, determine if a target value exists in the matrix.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Matrix Flattening**: Treat the 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array.
- **Binary Search on Matrix**: Use binary search to find the target.

#### Steps:
1. Treat the matrix as a single sorted list.
2. Use binary search by converting 1D indices to 2D indices.
   - Middle element: `matrix[mid // n][mid % n]`
3. Perform binary search similar to the basic binary search.

### 3. Koko Eating Bananas
**Problem**: Find the minimum eating speed K such that Koko can eat all bananas within H hours.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Search on Answer**: Search for the minimum possible value of K.
- **Feasibility Check**: Calculate the hours needed to eat all bananas with a given speed K.

#### Steps:
1. Set the range for K from 1 to the maximum pile size.
2. Use binary search to find the minimum K.
3. For each middle value of K, calculate the total hours needed.
4. Adjust the search range based on the feasibility check.

### 4. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
**Problem**: Given a rotated sorted array, find the minimum element.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Search on Rotated Array**: Use modified binary search to find the pivot point.
- **Pivot Point**: The point where the array rotation occurred.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers.
2. While `left` is less than `right`:
   - Calculate the middle index: `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[right]`, the minimum is in the right half.
   - Otherwise, the minimum is in the left half.
3. The `left` pointer will eventually point to the minimum element.

### 5. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
**Problem**: Given a rotated sorted array, find the index of a target value or return -1 if it does not exist.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Search with Pivot**: Find the pivot point and perform binary search in the appropriate half.

#### Steps:
1. Find the pivot point where the rotation occurred.
2. Perform binary search in the appropriate half:
   - If the target is in the left half, search between `left` and `pivot`.
   - If the target is in the right half, search between `pivot+1` and `right`.

### 6. Time-Based Key-Value Store
**Problem**: Implement a key-value store that can return the value of a key at a given timestamp.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Search for Closest Value**: Use binary search to find the closest timestamp.

#### Steps:
1. Store values in a dictionary with keys and a list of (timestamp, value) tuples.
2. For the `get` operation, use binary search to find the largest timestamp less than or equal to the given timestamp.

### 7. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
**Problem**: Find the median of two sorted arrays.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Search on Combined Length**: Use binary search to find the correct partition point.

#### Steps:
1. Use binary search to partition the smaller array.
2. Calculate the partition in the second array.
3. Adjust the search range based on the partitioning conditions.
4. Calculate the median based on the partition values.

### Additional Tips
- **Practice Variations**: Binary search can be applied in many variations. Practice different problems to get comfortable with these variations.
- **Understand Edge Cases**: Pay attention to edge cases such as empty arrays, arrays with one element, and duplicate values.
- **Use Visual Aids**: Drawing out the problem or using a debugger to visualize the binary search steps can help in understanding the algorithm.
