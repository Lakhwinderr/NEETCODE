Got it! Here are the key concepts and resources you should study to effectively tackle sliding window problems:

### Key Concepts to Study

1. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Understand how to maintain a window (subarray or substring) and how to slide it across the input to find the optimal solution.
   - Learn to identify when and how to expand or contract the window based on the problem requirements.

2. **Two-pointer Technique:**
   - Often used in conjunction with the sliding window technique.
   - Understand how to use two pointers to represent the boundaries of the window.

3. **Hash Maps or Frequency Counters:**
   - Learn to use hash maps to keep track of the frequency of elements within the window.
   - Useful for problems involving substrings with specific properties (e.g., character frequencies).

### Topics to Focus On for Each Question

1. **Longest Substring with Same Letter after K Changes:**
   - Focus on using the sliding window to maintain the count of characters within the window.
   - Learn to adjust the window size based on the allowed number of changes.

2. **Permutation in String:**
   - Understand how to use a sliding window to match the character frequencies of the substring to the target string.
   - Practice maintaining a frequency counter and comparing it with the target's frequency.

3. **Minimum Window Substring:**
   - Study how to use the sliding window to find the smallest window that contains all characters of the target string.
   - Learn to expand and contract the window based on character inclusion and exclusion.

4. **Sliding Window Maximum:**
   - Focus on using a deque to keep track of the maximum elements in the current window.
   - Practice updating the deque as the window slides to the right.

### Practice and Reinforcement

- Start by solving simpler sliding window problems to build your confidence.
- Gradually move on to more complex problems that require additional techniques like hash maps or deques.
- Consistently practice and review different types of sliding window problems to solidify your understanding. 

By focusing on these concepts and using the provided resources, you'll be well-equipped to solve sliding window problems effectively. Happy learning!
